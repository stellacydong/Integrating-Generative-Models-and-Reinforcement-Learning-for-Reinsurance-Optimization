# Insurance Simulation and Analysis Using Generative AI and RL

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for simulating and analyzing insurance environments using Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The project models claim distributions, evaluates stochastic behaviors, and analyzes results under different scenarios using custom AI models and environments.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to:
- Simulate insurance claim dynamics through generative AI models.
- Train and evaluate RL agents for optimizing surplus and managing risks in insurance operations.
- Analyze performance under stochastic, catastrophic, and scalable scenarios.

Key features include:
- **Generative Claim Models**: Variational Autoencoders for generating synthetic insurance claims.
- **Custom Insurance Environments**: Gym-based environments modeling realistic insurance operations.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Using PPO to optimize strategies for surplus management.
- **Analysis Modules**: Detailed exploration of convergence, scalability, and catastrophic scenarios.
