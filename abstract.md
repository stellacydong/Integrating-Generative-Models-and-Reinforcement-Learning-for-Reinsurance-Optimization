**Abstract**: Reinsurance optimization is crucial for insurers to manage risk exposure, maintain financial stability, and ensure solvency. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework integrating Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning for dynamic reinsurance optimization. The VAE models complex claim distributions, including rare catastrophic events, addressing data scarcity and variability. Meanwhile, PPO dynamically adjusts reinsurance parameters to maximize surplus and minimize ruin probability.

Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, including out-of-sample testing, stress-testing scenarios (e.g., pandemics, catastrophes), and scalability across portfolio sizes. Results demonstrate superior adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency, achieving higher final surpluses than traditional methods.

Key contributions include a hybrid approach for high-dimensional optimization, dynamic reinsurance parameterization, and validation against stochastic claim distributions. This transformative framework addresses modern reinsurance challenges and offers applications in multi-line insurance, catastrophe modeling, and risk-sharing strategies.
